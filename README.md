# WallE
A python web scraping project which automatically downloads a random and sets it on your desktop depending upon a few inputs.

# Project Description
I made this project in order to learn web scraping. I have used requests and beautiful soup 4 to scrap a webpage and download wallpapers from there. When you run the `main.py`, you have two choices - set any random wallpaper or choose a category and then set the random wallpaper from that category. 

# Python package dependencies

-requests
-BeautifulSoup4

First run `sudo pip -r requirements.txt` from your terminal
